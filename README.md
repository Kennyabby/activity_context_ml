# OVERVIEW

The ability to automatically recognize and comprehend human activities has grown in importance in today's fast-paced world across a variety of industries, from healthcare and sports analysis to smart homes and surveillance systems. Activity recognition, which is the process of identifying and categorizing human activities based on sensor data, is essential for enabling intelligent systems to comprehend and react to human behavior.

The goal of this project is to create an activity recognition model that accurately categorizes and forecasts various human activities. We can uncover patterns and connections hidden in sensor data by utilizing machine learning, which will allow us to build a powerful and effective activity recognition system.

In order to accomplish our goals, we will investigate and assess a variety of machine learning algorithms that have proven successful in activity recognition tasks. We will make use of publicly accessible datasets created specifically for activity recognition, which include information obtained from a variety of sensor sources, including magnetometers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes.

The project's phases will include data preprocessing, feature extraction, algorithm selection, model training, and performance assessment. Algorithms such as, Random Forests (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPClassifier), Logistic Regression (LR) as well as more sophisticated methods like deep learning models, such as KNeighbors Classifier, will all be examined.

The development of a precise, effective, and well-capable activity recognition model with respect to generalizing to unknown data is crucial to the success of this project. By doing this, we can realize the potential for real-time, context-aware systems that can comprehend and modify their behavior in response to human activity.
